    "\n",
    "Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technique for using computer vision to convert hand written text or old books and papers into electronic form.  One challenge with OCR is that occasionally a character cannot be recognized. In such a system, the computer can represent the unrecognized character using a `_`.  So for example, if the word being OCRed is `Book` and the computer did not recognize the second `o` it would represent the word as `Bo_k`. Humans can then read the OCRed file and fix the missing letters. To help these human readers it might be useful to have a program that when a word is missing a letter prints all of the possibilities for that word. For example for `Bo_k` the program might print `bock`, `book`, `bosk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program that prompts the user for a word containing __one__ (exactly one) `_` representing a missing letter.  The program should then use the `words.txt` file included in the `Lab12` folder and print out all of the possibilities for the word entered by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINT: Consider using an incremental development process.  Maybe start by displaying all words of the same length as you are trying to match.  Recall that `readline` includes a newline character on the end that you'll need to remove. Then consider adding a boolean function that checks if two words (one with a blank, one without) are a match."
